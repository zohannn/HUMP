# HUMP: a Human-like Upper-limb Motion Planner
This library is designed to generate human-like trajectories of the arms and the hands of humanoid robots.
Human-like single-arm and dual-arm motion is planned with a naturalistic obstacles-avoidance mechanism. The description of the planner and the results of different experimental tests are published in *Gulletta, G., Silva, E. C. e, Erlhagen, W., Meulenbroek, R., Costa, M. F. P., & Bicho, E. (2021).

## Upgrades
* The HUMP has been upgraded by [Sara SÃ¡](https://github.com/sarasa22) to support the collaborative robot Sawyer by Rethink Robotics&copy; (see [https://github.com/sarasa22/HUMP](https://github.com/sarasa22/HUMP))  
* The HUMP has been upgraded by [JoaoQPereira](https://github.com/JoaoQPereira) to support the collaborative robot UR5 by Universal Robots&copy; and integrate planing trajectories through a set of waypoints (see [https://github.com/JoaoQPereira/HUMP](https://github.com/JoaoQPereira/HUMP))
